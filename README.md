# Linear-Regression-using-a-dataset-with-used-car-sales

This is the second project for the Applied Statistics I1030 graduate course at City College of New York, Fall 2024. In this project, we use a Kaggle dataset on used car sales to analyze factors influencing car prices and develop a predictive model using linear regression.

## Overview
The objective of this project is to explore a dataset of used car sales in the U.S., analyze factors affecting car prices, and build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate car prices based on specific features. The analysis and model building are conducted in R, while the data were preprocessed in python.

## Dataset
We use the dataset available on Kaggle, which contains numerous entries on used car sales in the U.S.:
